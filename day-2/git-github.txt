Configure your name and your email
Open the Git bash if your device is Windows, or open the Mac terminal if your device is MacOS and then write the following commands

git config --global user.name 'yourname'
git config --global user.email 'youremail'

After doing git init
then the next step can be (git add .) which I usually use most of the times, 
But it we can also use 
git add fileName

in this process the file added will be the only one to be pushed to github

multiple files can be added
git add fileName1 fileName2 fileName3

wow It is even possible to add and commit at same time see the command below
  git commit -am 'commit message'

I want to test the staging of files
Another trial this time around God ooo
