## Styling of Texts

 ### 1. __Bold__
** ** or __ __	Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux) __This text is bold__ && **another way of using bold**
### 2. _Italic_
 	* * or _ _     	Command+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux) (*Italic*) _Italic2_
### ~~Strikethrough~~
 ~~This was mistaken text~~

 ### 3. **Bold _and_ nested italic**

 ### 4. ***All bold and italic***

 ### 5. Subscript <sub>Subsscript</sub>

 ### 6. Superscript <sup>Supercript</sup>

 ### 7. Qouting text
 > You can quote text with a >.

 ### 8. Quoting code
 Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

 To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
 ```
 git status
 git add 
 git commit
 ```
 ### 9. Supported color models
 In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

 The background color is `#ffffff`for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode
`rgb(9, 105, 218)`

### 10. Wraping links

### 11. Lists
- George Washington
* John Adams
+ Thomas Jefferson

**To order your list, precede each line with a number.**
1. first Number
1. Second Number
1. Third number

### 12.Nested List

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Visual Studio Code, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

1. First list item
   - First nested list
     * second nested list
