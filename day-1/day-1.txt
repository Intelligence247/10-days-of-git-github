This is my first text. I have never written on nano text editor before!!
some commands and their functions

	Command	 		Function
	mkdir		  	Used for creating folder
	touch			For creating files
	nano			To open a pad on the command and write some texts
	cat			to open the text written in the nano pad

mv					the mv is used to change a files name and also to move a																file to another	location


mv can be used to change a file name and also a folder name 

The mv and cp commands can be used to put files into a directory


While moving a file or folder from one directory to another, mv will move the file alone while cp will copy the file to another directory which means the file will still exist in the previous directory and the new place moved it too

To move multiple files from a directory to another we will need to include -t to mv (mv -t). this denotes that we are moving multiple files of folder

I tried moving to backward directory, and I realise it is impossible than to include (-t) with mv

(rmdir) is for removing folder while only (rm) is for removing a file 

to copy a whole folder to a new one (cp -r (existed folder) (new folder to be created))

rm -rf (name of folder), used to remove folder

Congratulations! Now you knew basic command lines
